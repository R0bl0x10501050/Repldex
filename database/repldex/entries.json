Feel free to reach out to a mod or staff member if there's any confusion about what this means.\n - No spam or advertising.   Your repls must go in the designated channel. Links to your programming streams must go in #programming.\n - Use each channel for its intended purpose. If you're not sure what the purpose is, ask in [#oof-topic](https://ReplDex.mat1.repl.co/entry/oof-topic).\n - Arguments about what language / framework / lib is the best in a certain context belongs in #lang-debate.\n - This server is English only.\n - We enforce the Discord ToS.\n - Keep it SFW, so don't use swear words, certain allusions, hate speech, etc.\n - NO doxing under any circumstances.\n - Do not argue with a moderator's decision publicly. If you feel that what they did is unfair, please contact an admin or use the bot   to resolve the issue.\n  \n Helping Guidelines:\n - Help people appropriately.\n - There are no stupid questions! Be patient - everyone starts somewhere. Things that are simple for you may be hard for others.\n - Do not spoon-feed, or just give them the correct code. This halts learning.\n  \n -Keep the discussion on the server, if possible.\n -We can't moderate DMs, but if someone DMs you and makes you uncomfortable please report it to us ASAP and we will handle it the best we can.\n -Asking a question in DMs will be seen as a offense now.\n -The moderators will use appropriate measurements if you break a rule, such as muting   you for a certain time, or even banning or kicking you.  \n  \n -Do not include characters that are not easily typeable on a standard us k\u0334\u033e\u035de\u0335\u033d\u034ay\u0336\u030e\u0309b\u0336\u0342\u0352\u00f6\u0338\u0301\u0309\u0103\u0336\u031ar\u0335\u030b\u0311d\u0337\u0310\u0360 in your username",

Recently, he has been learning many static languages including <a href=\"/entry/C\">C</a>, C++, and C# to get all the help roles on the repl.it discord. He is currently trying to learn <a href=\"/entry/Rust\">Rust</a>. He has also gotten on to the developer spotlight <a href=\"https://repl.it/talk/announcements/Developer-Spotlight-Cookies/48922\">here</a>!</p><p><br></p><p>On <a href=\"/entry/Repl.it\">Repl.it</a>, he has the most cycles (5870) on Repl.it (<a href=\"/entry/enigma\">enigma</a> did not get his legitimately), and is the only person to have more cycles than <a href=\"/entry/mat\">mat</a> and still is alive. He also likes to answer questions on repl.it and has made a client specifically for this. He also likes to make posts about the weekly and also games. Currently he is working on <a href=\"cookeylang\">cookeylang</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>Using next.js, 100 has created a parody site of Repl.it, called <a href=\"https://coder100-cool-coding-clan--coder100.repl.co/\">coder100.it</a>. He claims to be quite proud of the finished work. 100 has also discovered a new language called C# and praises it a bit too much. He also likes to use unity and boast his unity dark mode ($40 a month). Recently, he has gotten a brand new computer and he has not currently installed any software other than visual studio code on it.</p><p><br></p><p>For unknown reasons, he does not usually disclose any projects he has made when asked. He is, however, the creator of <a href=\"Chocolate\">Chocolate Bot</a> and also the creator of the repl.it database client for node.js on <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/replitdb-client\">npm</a>. He created it with the help of <a href=\"fluffin\">fluffin</a>. 100 is a 13-year-old 8th grader, and he plays the violin and piano (he is a <a href=\"/entry/musician\">musician</a>). He also lives in the <a href=\"/entry/United+States\">United States</a>. He did not like the deceased dyno bot, and spammed caps whenever dyno got overzealous. 100 likes to spam whenever the chat is dead and has been warned 3 times for this. If 100 has a question anytime, he would spam it in oof-topic until someone answered the question.</p><p><br></p><p>On discord, he is the 2518th member, 4645th member, and 5355th member. Which does not add up and is strange because Coder has only recalled leaving once. This entry has been vandalized once by <a href=\"sugarfi\">sugarfi</a>. He is most notable for saying, \"BRUH ... WELL SIN'T THIS SITUPSID\". Also, according to <a href=\"CodeSalvageON\">BlackyTheSlime</a>, he is a prodigy. According to <a href=\"sugarfi\">sugarfi</a>, he is a Microsoft junkie and a fascist dictator. Also, to recent statistics, 100 gets up to 14 pings a day from his help roles. 90% of all slow modes on repl.it discord has been caused by him as well. Hazel does not like 100 due to his immaturity and spam.</p>",

(left the project) TheSummit3145: C++ & Senior Coder. Specifications Interpreted Dynamic Strong Class-Based It is currently being developed and will be an entry for the 2020 language jam. Currently, it is going to be written in node.js, but after the lang jam, it will be translated into C++ to be compiled and distributed. Notable features include its nihilistic standard library (now has math, file I/O, and glitchy user input) and having classes.
